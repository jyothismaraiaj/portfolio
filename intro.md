## Internship Experience

**UB Center of Computational Research**, Buffalo, NY  
**Summer Research Intern** *(May 2023 – August 2023)*  
**Project:** Nodes Availability Analysis for Application Kernels Execution  
- Characterized unused nodes for running application kernels to manage node performance.  
- Gained proficiency in HPC systems through molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS.  
- Conducted performance analysis (parallel scaling and convergence) of pi estimation using Open MPI.  
- Visualized HPC node usage and daily job queues using time series plots.  
- Developed an algorithm to generate an availability matrix for unused nodes.  
- Created panel plots to illustrate available nodes based on resource utilization.  
- Optimized the algorithm runtime from nearly 40 minutes to 5 seconds by implementing computationally intensive components in C++ using Rcpp, improving performance and scalability.
